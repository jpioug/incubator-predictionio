INFO: Assuming you are following the directory structure in the followoing,
replace `/home/abc` with your own home directory wherever you see it.

## Downloading Source Code

Download Apache PredictionIO (incubating) <%= data.versions.pio %> from an
Apache
[mirror](https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/incubator/predictionio/0.10.0-incubating/apache-predictionio-<%=
data.versions.pio %>.tar.gz).

## Building

Run the following at the directory where you downloaded the source code to build
Apache PredictionIO (incubating).

```
$ tar zxvf apache-predictionio-<%= data.versions.pio %>.tar.gz
$ cd apache-predictionio-<%= data.versions.pio %>
$ ./make-distribution.sh
```

You should see something like the following when it finishes building
successfully.

```
...
PredictionIO-<%= data.versions.pio %>/sbt/sbt
PredictionIO-<%= data.versions.pio %>/conf/
PredictionIO-<%= data.versions.pio %>/conf/pio-env.sh
PredictionIO binary distribution created at PredictionIO-<%= data.versions.pio %>.tar.gz
```

Extract the binary distribution you have just built.

```
$ tar zxvf PredictionIO-<%= data.versions.pio %>.tar.gz
```


## Installing Dependencies

Let us install dependencies inside a subdirectory of the Apache PredictionIO
(incubating) installation. By following this convention, you can use
Apache PredictionIO (incubating)'s default configuration as is.

```
$ mkdir PredictionIO-<%= data.versions.pio %>/vendors
```
