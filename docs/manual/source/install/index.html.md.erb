[//]: # (<%= partial 'shared/install/proceed_template' %>)

## Prerequisites

It is **very important** to meet the minimum version of the following
technologies that power Apache PredictionIO (incubating).

* Apache Hadoop 2.4.0 (optional, required only if YARN and HDFS are needed)
* Apache Spark 1.4.0 for Hadoop 2.4
* Java SE Development Kit 7

and one of the following sets:

* PostgreSQL 9.1

or

* MySQL 5.1

or

* Apache HBase 0.98.6
* Elasticsearch 1.4.0

If you are running on a single machine, we recommend a minimum of 2GB memory.

INFO: If you are using Linux, Apache Spark local mode, which is the default
operation mode without further configuration, may not work. In that case,
configure your Apache Spark to run in [standalone cluster
mode](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/spark-standalone.html).
